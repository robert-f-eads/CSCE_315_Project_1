                    <p> Developed as a team of two in partnership with a licensed, certified speech-language pathologist, 
                        Stutter Speak is a VR application built in Unreal Engine 4 using a blend of C++ and Blueprint. 
                        Designed to help those who stutter improve confidence in their public speaking ability, the application 
                        puts the user on stage in front of a digital audience to closely simulate the public speaking experience. 
                        By giving users the ability to self-track stuttering and rate themselves on different aspects of their speech, 
                        the application can then provide helpful feedback and graphical representations of data to show progress over time. 
                        Stutter Speak is available for the Oculus Quest 2 via the Oculus App Lab store.

                <h3> Why Computer Science?</h3>
                <p>The areas of the computer science field that interest me the most are mixed reality and artificial 
                    intelligence/machine learning. These technologies, along with coding from an elementary school age,  
                    are the things that got me hooked and pushed me towards becoming a computer science major in the first place.
                </p>
                <p> I got my first virtual reality headset sophomore year of high school and I have loved the technology ever since. 
                    While most people I showed it to only saw it as a toy that I could play video games with, I quickly realized it could 
                    be used for so much more. With the fields of medical, automotive, and architecture moving towards a more 
                    technology-driven future, I thought these were just a few of the industries that mixed reality could be used in a 
                    productive and business-oriented manner. I was fortunate enough to intern at General Motors, working on a virtual 
                    reality application, over this past summer and got to see just one of the many uses for virtual reality and augmented 
                    reality that General Motors has in store for the future. The older I get, the more areas I find that could benefit 
                    from the technology, and the more excited I get for what is to come.
                </p>
                <p> Machine learning & artificial intelligence is the other big area of computer science that draws my interest the 
                    most. Watching Iron Man as a kid and seeing JARVIS, made my mind run wild. Having a virtual assistant that could 
                    do all that by simply uttering a phrase gave me a hunger for that power as a kid. As I grew up, I realized 
                    technology like that is a little farther out than will be attainable in the near future, but it gives me an 
                    ultimate goal to contribute to a system that may one day create a JARVIS-like AI to intelligently manage our 
                    homes and our lives.

            <p> As a stutterer, I panel for classes taught about speech pathology and more specifically stuttering. 
                This creates an opportunity for SLPs-in-training (speech-language pathologists) to ask questions and get 
                real feedback about their experiences from people who stutter and have gone through speech therapy.

            <p> Volunteering on Saturday mornings with the Dallas chapter of the Texas Ramps Project, I constructed ramp 
                floorings and handrails, as well as drilled and screwed into sidewalks and foundations to attach ramps. 
                These ramps were for handicapped and wheelchair-bound residents who could not afford ramps but needed 
                them to exit and enter their dwellings.
