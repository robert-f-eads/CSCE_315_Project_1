            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <a><img src="/images/Profile_Picture_Robert_Eads.png"></a>
            <p> An active computer science apprentice at Texas A&M University in my junior year of college. 
                I'm a dedicated developer who enjoys learning new languages and experimenting with unfamiliar technologies. 
                Currently exploring different facets of mixed reality and am looking to gain experience in the field of 
                software engineering or virtual reality development. I whole heartly embrace Texas culture and am fond of 
                running, playing basketball, and listening to music.

        <h3>Stutter Speak</h3>
        <p>May 2021 - August 2021</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/Jableman19/StutterSpeak" target="_blank"><img src="/images/GitHub_Logo_Dark.png" alt="View the repository on GitHub"></a>
        <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4159850590802633/" target="_blank"><img src="/images/SideQuest_Logo_Dark.png" alt="View the application in App Labs"></a>
        <p> Developed as a team of two in partnership with a licensed, certified speech-language pathologist, 
            Stutter Speak is a VR application built in Unreal Engine 4 using a blend of C++ and Blueprint. 
            Designed to help those who stutter improve confidence in their public speaking ability, the application 
            puts the user on stage in front of a digital audience to closely simulate the public speaking experience. 
            By giving users the ability to self-track stuttering and rate themselves on different aspects of their speech, 
            the application can then provide helpful feedback and graphical representations of data to show progress over time. 
            Stutter Speak is available for the Oculus Quest 2 via the Oculus App Lab store.

        <p> Picked up as part time work during spring semester of 2022, responsibilities centered on daily communication with 
            customers, creating custom requested websites on a project by project basis, and collaborativly coding with 
            teammates to create, deploy, and manage custom python bots running connections to a MongoDB database.

        <p> Developed as an assignment for class, this website was coded in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
            Created with a togglable stylesheet in mind, the website can easy switch between two different looks
            with the press of a button.

        <h3>Saxophone Simulator</h3>
        <p>May 2021</p>
        <p> Created with the Unity game engine in C# alongside my parnter Jonah, "Saxo Sim" was taken from concept to 
            completion in just over one week. Used as a simple way to gain familiarity with version control and coding in a 
            team environment for my partner and I. Design and implimention of the overall UI as well as coding the 
            note name display when a sound played was my responsibility.

        <p>View my resume</p>
        <button type="button">Resume</button>
        <p>The areas of the computer science field that interest me the most are mixed reality and artificial 
            intelligence/machine learning. These technologies, along with coding from an elementary school age,  
            are the things that got me hooked and pushed me towards becoming a computer science major in the first place.
        </p>
        <p> I got my first virtual reality headset sophomore year of high school and I have loved the technology ever since. 
            While most people I showed it to only saw it as a toy that I could play video games with, I quickly realized it could 
            be used for so much more. With the fields of medical, automotive, and architecture moving towards a more 
            technology-driven future, I thought these were just a few of the industries that mixed reality could be used in a 
            productive and business-oriented manner. I was fortunate enough to intern at General Motors, working on a virtual 
            reality application, over this past summer and got to see just one of the many uses for virtual reality and augmented 
            reality that General Motors has in store for the future. The older I get, the more areas I find that could benefit 
            from the technology, and the more excited I get for what is to come.
        </p>
        <p> Machine learning & artificial intelligence is the other big area of computer science that draws my interest the 
            most. Watching Iron Man as a kid and seeing JARVIS, made my mind run wild. Having a virtual assistant that could 
            do all that by simply uttering a phrase gave me a hunger for that power as a kid. As I grew up, I realized 
            technology like that is a little farther out than will be attainable in the near future, but it gives me an 
            ultimate goal to contribute to a system that may one day create a JARVIS-like AI to intelligently manage our 
            homes and our lives.

        <h3>National Stuttering Association Educational Paneling </h3>
        <a href="https://westutter.org/" target="_blank"><img src="/images/NSA_Color.png" alt="View National Stuttering Association here"></a>
        <p> As a stutterer, I panel for classes taught about speech pathology and more specifically stuttering. 
            This creates an opportunity for SLPs-in-training (speech-language pathologists) to ask questions and get 
            real feedback about their experiences from people who stutter and have gone through speech therapy.

        <p> As a volunteer, my responsibilities included packing meal bags, sorting food, and wrapping pallets at the 
            North Texas Food Bank (NTFB). The NTFB is a food bank serving the north Texas area and has been my go-to 
            volunteer spot for the past 6 years.

        <a href="https://www.texasramps.org/" target="_blank"><img src="/images/TRP_Color.png" alt="View Texas Ramp Project here"></a>
        <p> Volunteering on Saturday mornings with the Dallas chapter of the Texas Ramps Project, I constructed ramp 
            floorings and handrails, as well as drilled and screwed into sidewalks and foundations to attach ramps. 
            These ramps were for handicapped and wheelchair-bound residents who could not afford ramps but needed 
            them to exit and enter their dwellings.
