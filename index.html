            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <a><img src="/favicon.ico"></a>
            <p> An active computer science apprentice at Texas A&M University in my junior year of college. 
                I'm a dedicated developer who enjoys learning new languages and experimenting with unfamiliar technologies. 
                Currently exploring different facets of mixed reality and am looking to gain experience in the field of 
                software engineering or virtual reality development. I whole heartly embrace Texas culture and am fond of 
                running, playing basketball, and listening to music.

        <h3>Stutter Speak</h3>
        <p>May 2021 - August 2021</p>
        <a><img src="/favicon.ico"></a>
        <a><img src="/favicon.ico"></a>
        <p> Developed as a team of two in partnership with a licensed, certified speech-language pathologist, 
            Stutter Speak is a VR application built in Unreal Engine 4 using a blend of C++ and Blueprint. 
            Designed to help those who stutter improve confidence in their public speaking ability, the application 
            puts the user on stage in front of a digital audience to closely simulate the public speaking experience. 
            By giving users the ability to self-track stuttering and rate themselves on different aspects of their speech, 
            the application can then provide helpful feedback and graphical representations of data to show progress over time. 
            Stutter Speak is available for the Oculus Quest 2 via the Oculus App Lab store.

        <p> Created with the Unity game engine in C# alongside my parnter Jonah, "Saxo Sim" was taken from concept to 
            completion in just over one week. Used as a simple way to gain familiarity with version control and coding in a 
            team environment for my partner and I. Design and implimention of the overall UI as well as coding the 
            note name display when a sound played was my responsibility.
